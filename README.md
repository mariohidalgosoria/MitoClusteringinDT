# MitoClusteringinDT
The current repository includes matlab and C programs employed to analyze data generated by executable programs
written in Fortran-90 by: https://github.com/lenafabr and mariohidalgosoria
these programs simulate the interaction of different cluster size mitochondria moving in dendritic trees.
They give as an output:
STC.snap.txt: with the coordinates of all different cluster sizes distributed in the tree

STC.clsnap.txt : with the different cluster sizes at the end of the run     

STC.emsnap.txt: with total mass of mitochondria on each different branch of the dendritic tree

This repository is divided in sub-directories as follows:
Data: contains examples of data files with the coordinates and cluster size of mitochondria in dendritic trees.

ClusterSizeDist: conatins Matlab programs to compute the final cluster size distribution of mitochondria
the volume density per branch extracted from simulations an our mean field model. Also includes Matlab
programs to compute the mitochondrial volume density per mesh site using simulation data and our mean field model.

CanonicalResult: Contains Matlab programs to compute mean field calculations of the total mitochondrial mass in the tree
and the average cluster size of mitochondria present in the tree.

DistEnrCSR: Contains Matlab programs to compute the distal erichment of mitochondria and the relative cluster size 
per region, predicted by our mean field model.

DistEnrU: Contains Matlab programs to compute the distal erichment of mitochondria versus the dimensionless parameters of our model

Asymm: Contains Matlab programs to compute the asymmetry of mitochondrial volume prediceted by the mean field model in the 
dendritic tree, for different scaling rules of branching in dendrites.
